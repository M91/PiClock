# PiClock
A Fancy Clock built around a monitor and a Raspberry Pi

This project started out as a way to waste a Saturday afternoon.
I had a Raspberry Pi and an extra monitor and had just taken down an analog clock from my livingroom wall.
I was contemplating getting a radio sync'ed analog clock to replace it, so I didn't have to worry about
it being accurate.

But instead the PiClock was born.

The early days and evolution of it are chronicled on my blog http://n0bel.net/v1/index.php/projects/raspberry-pi-clock

Due to changes in Weather Underground, PiClock needed a new provider for weather information.  A decision
to build the project in JS was made, and PiClockJS was born.
